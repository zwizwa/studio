TODO:
- sync microbruite to the volcas
- find a good sequencer
- mount all the "knobs" to a movable surface
- set up a good echo/delay digitally
- set up midi for all
- route guitar effects chain through mixer
- focus on non-portable setup first built around delta1010
- later add "easy detach" portability
- find a simple touch screen

8 channels should be enough.  All of them have direct out to
delta1010.

I have 4 channels direct

Not sure why this didn't work earlier.  Too noisy?  Let's try again..

The reason was feedback, since this needs to be set pre-fader, and the
self-send on the return channel is too strong. It's doable for most
cases but easy to trigger.
