aux send to digital in (e.g. for reverb/delay) is not really necessary
as they can be sent digitally.

bittons: part mute
bottom 3 rows: synth control (incremental)


TODO:
- sync microbruite to the volcas (all on midi sync?)
- find a good sequencer
- mount all the "knobs" to a movable surface
- set up a good echo/delay digitally
- set up midi for all
- route guitar effects chain through mixer
- focus on non-portable setup first built around delta1010
- later add "easy detach" portability
- find a simple touch screen

Find a good sequencer, or build one.

8 channels should be enough.  All of them have direct out to
delta1010.

I have 4 channels direct

Not sure why this didn't work earlier.  Too noisy?  Let's try again..

The reason was feedback, since this needs to be set pre-fader, and the
self-send on the return channel is too strong. It's doable for most
cases but easy to trigger.

- map all midi devices to some other messages (osc?)
- program bcr2000 for mixerm, mute botton + inc control operation

Looks like it's necessary to use alsa midi interface, as multi-port
devices only show up with a single legacy /dev/midi? port.

Entry: separate exo and studio
Date: Sat Mar 19 23:26:00 EDT 2016

I'd like to build this into something dedicated, and handle all
starting/stopping from Erlang as well.

If events need to be exchanged between exo and studio, it would likely
not be such a huge deal..
