Not sure why this didn't work earlier.  Too noisy?  Let's try again..

The reason was feedback, since this needs to be set pre-fader, and the
self-send on the return channel is too strong. It's doable for most
cases but easy to trigger.

Using the legacy midi devices (and alsa's rawmidi?) is single-access only.
Two options:
- create a daemon that converts midi to osc

Since I need the "accumulator" anyway, let's do this in erlang (exo).

Looks like it's necessary to use alsa midi interface, as multi-port
devices only show up with a single legacy /dev/midi? port.

Making exo/c_src/midi_in.c to simply map back to raw MIDI in erlang.
Alternatively, pass through the full binary event structs.

Next: figure out how to set tempo, send midi sync, send start/stop to
all clients at once, and configure volca's to sync to midi.

So some questions.

- Should I use the sequencer or the raw midi?  Maybe jack midi (which

- There are 4 ports, but only one /dev/midiCD0 device


This http://wiki.linuxaudio.org/faq/start
mentions alsa sequencer should be used for interconnecting applications.
Jack MIDI might just be for recording, then?

No, looks like the reason has to do with high-resolution timing.
250kHz not being enough.

I wonder, is it possible to have the time sync sent out by the sequencer?

I need to look into the alsa sources...  Too much old stale

Entry: jack midi or alsa sequencer?
Date: Thu Mar 17 00:57:03 EDT 2016

It seems that people are standardizing on jack, and jack midi.
For new things it seems best to not use alsa sequencer.

http://www.teuton.org/~gabriel/jack_midi_clock/
http://wiki.linuxaudio.org/faq/start#qwhat_is_the_difference_between_jack-midi_and_alsa-midi

Since jack is used for audio anyway, it seems best to use it for midi
as well.  Jack can then provide abstraction of alsa sequencer or alsa
hardware.

jack_midi_clock.c uses these calls:

      send_rt_message(port_buf, 0, MIDI_RT_CLOCK);
      send_rt_message(port_buf, next_tick_offset, MIDI_RT_CLOCK);

static void send_rt_message(void* port_buf, jack_nframes_t time, uint8_t rt_msg) {
  uint8_t *buffer;
  buffer = jack_midi_event_reserve(port_buf, time, 1);
  if(buffer) {
    buffer[0] = rt_msg;
  }
}

  if ((mclk_output_port = jack_port_register(j_client, "mclk_out", JACK_DEFAULT_MIDI_TYPE, JackPortIsOutput, 0)) == 0) {


jack_midi_event_reserve()
- can be called from the process() method
- needs sorted input

Overall this seems like a much better approach to handling timer
issues.  Synchronize to the audio sample (block) clock for logical
time base, and have jack handle the event scheduling details.

For other things, alsa seq is probably ok.

One thing to figure out is how usable erlang would be for midi event
processing.

Do I really need alsa sequencers for new code?  For new softsynths,
best to stick with jack.

a2jmidid (separate app) is apparently better than seq and raw
http://home.gna.org/a2jmidid/

the reason to use a2jmidid is that it allows to run jack in -X raw
mode, while still allowing to bridge jack midi ports to (wrapped)
sequencer ports.


Yeah need to play with it.  Coexist. Conclusions:




Entry: audio/midi Routing setup
Date: Thu Mar 17 01:55:41 EDT 2016

MIDI
- Use jack midi for anything that uses jack audio already 
- Use jack midi for hi-rez timing (based off of sample clock) (ex: jack_midi_clock.c)
- Use ordinary alsa seq for non-timing critical bits (e.g. erlang hacking?)
- Create a jack midi interface to erlang (also for better timing).
- Run jack in raw mode, use a2jmidid to connect sequencers to raw ports

AUDIO
- jack
- pulseaudio jack bridge (optional)
- pd (no jack midi tho)
- rai soft synths with jack midi / osc or pd on stdin

Entry: jack changes

separated midi and control clients so they can use different buffering
schemes.  control: rpc, midi: packet switching, with possible drops.
still not happy with the possible drops (really a design problem) but
for now we're fine.


Entry: erlang sequencer
Date: Thu Mar 24 11:19:54 EDT 2016

next is event sequencing.  trouble is in the "note off" events.

my idea had been to use a process for an event stream, but it's not
clear if that's a good idea.  ordered queues are probably better, but
more clumsy to work with.

yesterday i was thinking about the problem of interface
vs. representation.  in my payed gig i've been dealing a lot with this
problem: to build something that has a model quite different from the
way it is implemented.

in any case it would be a nice experiment to see how far the erlang
scheduler can be trusted with accurate sequencing.

what i really want though, is infinite (floating point) timing
resolution.


a possible solution:

- build a model in erlang that can in principle be translated to
  bare-bones implementation (state machines + priority queue).

- once it works, implement the state machine scheduler

Entry: Routing
Date: Thu Apr  7 21:40:30 EDT 2016

Everything is set up.  Next: routing.
Basic tool is serv:broadcaster (fan-out) and receive selection.

Basically, event comes in at port and based on what it is, it needs to
be dispatched to one or more registered processes.

It doesn't seem like a good idea to route everything to every process.
So that gives a way to organize.

The router is a set of {Predicate,Process} rules.
Broadcaster could be extended to that.

emacs cursor.

# JACK: the dbus solution is not very robust. plus i need more control

I've always felt the need to have to choose between synths and
samples.  Is that still the case?

Also, reproducibility has been a problem.  But that conflicts with the
lure of the analog knobs..

And allow for some "job well done" gloating afterwards..

What about UI.  I want to build my own widgets in a way that makes
sense, e.g. using constraints or some declarative approach.  As a

ever run on a low-end machine (unlikely).  Latter if it's ok to use a
2010-style laptop which can run reasonable 2D compositing and can host
Haskell.

Really, thinking about synth networks, it might be best to completely
separate UI and sound, so platform would not be such a problem.  The
question would be: is Haskell responsive enough?

Some requirements:
- would have to be frame-synchronous: no tearing
- I'd like to avoid X11

- Studio will be always running.  Run it inside of emacs.

- Checked the fasttrack as main 2track recorder.  Seems to work ok.

Entry: A sender and a receiver
Date: Sun Aug 13 21:08:05 EDT 2017

So I want to think about making this easier.

I have a sender, say a midi knob plugged into a PC somewhere in the
distributed network, and I want to use it as an input to some process.

How to tell the knob to send its data?

- Register the pid to the controller's parent
- Have the parent do filtering

how to make this work with "midi learn?"

this only works if all the controls can be left silent, or at least to
filter out those controls that do not yet have an assignment.


where is this actually coming in?
EDIT: arch uses a hub

to receive a port's messages, register a filter for its address to the
midi_hub

what this can't do is midi learn.

hub would need to implement that.



Entry: current jack arch
Date: Sun Aug 13 21:21:28 EDT 2017

jackd, wraps the daemon. listens to stdout for connect events.

jack_control, wraps port process to do things like jack_connect().

jack_midi, wraps port process
has currently 16 in, 16 out which are connected to the physical ports
sends everything to midi hub

midi hub is serv:hub

%% Midi in. Translate to symbolic form.
jack_midi_handle({Port,{data,<<MidiPort,Data/binary>>}}, Port) ->
    lists:foreach(
      fun(Msg) -> serv:hub_send(midi_hub, {{jack,MidiPort},Msg}) end,
      decode(Data)),
    Port;


TODO: hub needs to register processes, so if they die it can remove
them from the list.  It was determined to do filtering at the source
-- that's always a good idea.



Entry: Implementing midi learn, improving hub
Date: Sun Aug 13 21:34:04 EDT 2017

Send message to hub: I want to subscribe a part

- add registry (probably already in newer erl_tools) to avoid stale pids.

- midi hub should use sets as filters, so a filter can easily be
  added.

- midi learn requires "quiet".  otherwise, do it for things that are
  not yet assigned.

    Port ! {self(), {command, <<Mask:32/little, Bin/binary>>}},
    Port.


Which is more low level.

midi_jack doesn't seem to be registered to anything.  actually that's the daemon.

midi needs to be sent through a client.

i need to write down how the processes are set up.

I think the jack daemon is hard-linked to midi_hub.  That is bad
practice.  Fix this to not used registry, but use an application
namespace.

Yeah this needs to be cleaned up a little.

Get dialyzer + typer up then refactor.

But make it work first.  That is busywork.



Ok, now I get it.

To connect midi ports, use a jack client.  Routing through Erlang
maybe has too much delay?

midi:jack_midi(Client,NI,NO,ClockMask).


I believe the idea has always been to allow this to be an "os" for
components that are tighter and can communicate at the jack level.


Ok.  Now get something working.

Lost appetite..  Time to go to bed probably.

So if I understand correctly:
studio:midi has 16 midi ports
5,6,7,8 are connected to the analogs, and should have the time code.

sqlite> .dump
PRAGMA foreign_keys=OFF;
BEGIN TRANSACTION;
CREATE TABLE midiport (
       port_id    INTEGER PRIMARY KEY NOT NULL,
       port_name  TEXT    NOT NULL
);
INSERT INTO "midiport" VALUES(1,'BCR2000-MIDI-1');
INSERT INTO "midiport" VALUES(2,'BCR2000-MIDI-2');
INSERT INTO "midiport" VALUES(3,'BCR2000-MIDI-3');
INSERT INTO "midiport" VALUES(5,'USB-Midi-4i4o-MIDI-1');

CREATE TABLE midiclock (
       port_name  TEXT    PRIMARY KEY NOT NULL

INSERT INTO "midiclock" VALUES('USB-Midi-4i4o-MIDI-1');
INSERT INTO "midiclock" VALUES('USB-Midi-4i4o-MIDI-2');
INSERT INTO "midiclock" VALUES('USB-Midi-4i4o-MIDI-3');
INSERT INTO "midiclock" VALUES('USB-Midi-4i4o-MIDI-4');
INSERT INTO "midiclock" VALUES('MicroBrute-MIDI-1');
CREATE VIEW midiclock_mask as
select sum(1<<port_id) from midiclock left join midiport on midiclock.port_name = midiport.port_name;
COMMIT;


Clock is set to 14, which is wrong.  According to config:

sqlite> select * from midiclock_mask
   ...> ;
16864


I think I might have pulled in erl_tools, which then breaks sql?


Ok, so it's starting the other one.
;;(defun my-start-studio      () (interactive) (my-start-erl-prj "studio"))
(defun my-start-studio      () (interactive) (my-start-erl "studio" "/i/tom/studio/erl.sh"))

I don't even know which is the correct one.

The one on /i/tom/studio has a different database.
Resolved.  Needed to do db_init.sh again.  

Maybe just get rid of studio directory on zoe then?

EDIT: 2019/4/18 this happened somewhere in the past.  See exo log.


Entry: Midi patterns
Date: Thu Apr 18 17:39:01 EDT 2019

So what if I have a pattern. How do I play it back?  Now that I now
how to properly do reloads, this might be a lot easier to use.

EDIT: I completely forgot.  This needs to be discoverable.  At
startup, it needs to play a pattern on one of the synths.

EDIT: Reverse engineering.  jack_midi is not registered.  Get pid from
studio_sup.  That process supports message:

{midi,Mask,Data}

P ! {midi, -1, midi:encode({on, 0, 64, 100})}.

That crashed it.

Probably the -1.  It also takes symbolic midi.

This now works:

f(P),{ok,P}=studio_sup:find(midi_jack).
obj:get(P,midi) ! {midi, -1, {on, 0, 64, 100}}.
obj:get(P,midi) ! {midi, -1, {off, 0, 64, 100}}.

But it seems it is missing a whole lot of infrastructure.


Entry: Sqlite
Date: Thu Apr 18 17:51:14 EDT 2019

So basically, all that can be replaced by code, because it is
integration code.  A module save is going to be just as fast as a DB
save.



Entry: Review?
Date: Thu Apr 18 19:55:21 EDT 2019

This was written when I did not have a whole lot of experience yet
with some Erlang corner cases.  Do a review, and client it up a bit.

EDIT: I'm afraid that the timing won't be good enough.  To do
something good, do it at the C end at Jack frame rate.  Or change the
jackd daemon to Rust to have a less hacky dev experience.



Entry: Synths
Date: Thu Apr 18 21:35:12 EDT 2019

64  bass
128 keys

I can't find the drums though.
Ok they are just under different keys.

So it's clear what this needs: something that can do midi routing,
midi recording and midi playback with perfect timing.  So run it
inside jack, and run the soft synths, midi and sampler all in the same
core.

This is not for Erlang.  What erlang is good for is to connect the
midi to other shit on the network, or vice versa.  Act as a bridge,
but don't let it do timing-sensitive things.


Entry: A recording format.
Date: Thu Apr 18 22:09:29 EDT 2019

It really needs to go just in RAM, so it doesn't matter all that much.
Saving it to disk will need time stamps for midi.  Maybe just midi
files?



Entry: A recorder
Date: Mon Apr 22 11:50:19 EDT 2019

It's clear that doing midi in Erlang is not going to cut it, so do it
in Jack instead.  Extend the current Jack code to do midi, and then
replace the existing C code.

What I want: something that's continuously recording, but can take
snapshots.

Basically, there is no reason not to record continuously these days.
Just use a circular buffer, and create an interface to go back and
find things.

So I already have a format for this.  It just needs to be chunked to
also do audio.  Let's reserve a drive for it.  This can just be USB.

EDIT: 
34e6aa85-8440-4d19-ac76-5646a856443e 500GB Seagate USB2

Record jack in/out and all midi in/out.

Jack client can do the chunking and send a message to erlang.  This is
48kHz * 2 * 8 * 2 or (* 48000 2 8 2) 1.5MByte/sec _+ MIDI.

That should not be an issue.
The disk is 500GB, so about 90 hours:

(/ (* 500.0 1000 1000 1000)
   (* 60 60 (* 48000 2 8 2)))
90.42245370370371

Use a global start/stop knob.
Start a new file as with the video recorder.

Remount r/o on stop.

What is the next step?
- instantiate recorder
- create jack client to tap the busses



Entry: Recorder
Date: Mon Apr 22 13:45:26 EDT 2019

Bulk it up into one second chunks?  Jack with a frame size of 64,
which is a lot of pressure on Erlang without any good reason for it.
Midi can be left as is, but the audio should probably be reduced.
Maybe pick something that can easily resolve 20Hz so FFTs can be used
in place on the data to scan for frequency content.

Say 10Hz is the block rate, that is about 4K sample blocks which is
128K frames for 16x16bit channels.

This is reasonable.  On par with cameras.  Studio could also record a
camera feed.


Entry: TODO
Date: Mon Apr 22 14:13:47 EDT 2019

- jack audio client, bulks up a number of channels into 4K time
  samples, and sends it out to the recorder.

  this can be done inside a single Rust core application that ties
  into Erlang.  the recorder can be Erlang

  i already have this client somewhere, so next step is to put it in
  studio.

- the process that starts the jack daemon and sets up connections can
  just be kept as is for now.  later incorporate in Rust once it
  becomes easy to do.



Entry: Next
Date: Tue Apr 23 15:08:51 EDT 2019

Rust code is currently in exo.  It's fine there for now.  Once context
is active, moving it will be easy.

It starts on the studio node:
exo:start(exo_rs).

exo_rs:call({open,{jack_client,<<"test">>}}).
<0.617.0>: Unknown source port in attempted (dis)connection src_name [rust_jack_sine:sine_out] dst_name [system:playback_1]
{ok,0}

First issue: connecting ports.  I've install qjackctl but it doesn't
see the running jack instance.  EDIT: It works.  I was using patchbay,
not connect..

Wanted:
- Get a list of ports
- Connect command for ports
- A "connect daemon" : restore connections on restart
- Store connections in a db?
- MIDI learn

Basically, I want it to remember how it was last set up, and possibly
restore it as well.  Maybe also use version numbers of code.

This needs some refactoring.  The code is set up in weird ways.  It
would fare better with a flat supervisor structure.

I don't find a good starting point.

Assume the list of ports is known.  Add code to just do a connection?



Entry: Studio c build appears to be broken
Date: Tue Apr 23 18:47:07 EDT 2019

Change it to redo.

Then make it support fast reload, so the C code becomes easy to
change.  For glue code Rust likely will be overkill.  Rust is for
data-heavy applications that need speed and memory efficiency.
